# Melanoma Tumor Detection Project

## Introduction
Deep Learning has emerged as a powerful tool in medical imaging, showing great potential in aiding the health community in the detection and diagnosis of melanoma. By leveraging deep learning algorithms, medical images such as dermoscopy or biopsies can be analyzed with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. This approach can assist in classifying melanoma into different subtypes, such as basal cell melanoma, squamous cell melanoma, or malignant melanoma. By training models on large datasets of labeled melanoma images, deep learning algorithms can learn to distinguish between various types, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of melanoma imaging, ultimately leading to improved patient care and outcomes in dermatologic oncology.

## Problem Statement
Accurate detection and classification of melanoma are crucial for the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients. However, manual interpretation of medical images, such as dermoscopic scans, can be time-consuming and subjective, leading to potential errors and delays in patient care. Therefore, there is a need for an automated and reliable method to detect and classify melanoma from medical images.

## Aim of the Study
The aim of this study is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Keras framework that can accurately detect and classify melanoma tumors from a large dataset of curated images. The CNN will be trained on a dataset consisting of 13,900 images to learn the patterns and features associated with different skin types and melanoma's diverse manifestations. The goal is to develop a reliable tool to assist dermatologists in early detection and accurate diagnosis.

## Methodology
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
The dataset used in this study comprises 13,900 images, including various types of melanoma. To prepare the images for training, several preprocessing steps are applied. The images are resized and normalized to ensure consistency and improve the training process. Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip, are employed to create a robust training set and prevent overfitting.

### Model Development
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is developed using the Keras framework. The architecture of the CNN includes multiple convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. This setup is designed to capture the intricate patterns in the images, enabling the model to learn the distinguishing features of melanoma.

### Training and Evaluation
The CNN is trained using the preprocessed dataset. Various parameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, are tuned to achieve optimal performance. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation is employed to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

## Results and Discussion
The trained CNN model demonstrated high accuracy in detecting and classifying melanoma tumors. The evaluation metrics indicate the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between different types of melanoma. The implementation of data augmentation and dropout regularization significantly improved the model's generalization capabilities, reducing overfitting and enhancing performance on unseen data.

## Conclusion
This project illustrates the potential of deep learning in revolutionizing melanoma detection and diagnosis. By developing a robust CNN model, it is possible to assist dermatologists in early detection and accurate diagnosis, ultimately improving patient care in dermatologic oncology. Future work can focus on exploring alternative neural network architectures, incorporating additional data sources, and further optimizing the model's performance.
